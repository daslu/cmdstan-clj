# cmdstan-clj

[cmdstan-clj](https://github.com/scicloj/cmdstan-clj) is a Clojure wrapper of [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) probabilistic programming language that uses the [CmdStan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan) CLI.

**Artifact:** [![(Clojars coordinates)](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.scicloj/cmdstan-clj.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.scicloj/cmdstan-clj)

**Status:** an evolving proof-of-concept.



::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(ns index
  (:require
   ;; cmdstan-clj API:
   [scicloj.cmdstan-clj.v1.api :as stan]
   ;; Tablecloth for table processing
   [tablecloth.api :as tc]
   ;; Hanamicloth for data visualization
   [scicloj.hanamicloth.v1.api :as haclo]
   ;; Kindly for specifying how to visualize things:
   [scicloj.kindly.v4.kind :as kind]))
```
:::



## Walkthrough

Here we follow [the introductory example](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/example_model_data.html) from Stan' documentation.

Let us define our model.

In our probabilistic model here,
we have we have an observed vector $y$
of $N$ samples.
We have an unobserved parameter $\theta \sim Beta(1,1)$,
and the elements of $y$ are conditionally independent
given $\theta$, and distributed $Bernoulli(\theta)$ each.


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(def model-code
  "
data {
      int<lower=0> N;
      array[N] int<lower=0,upper=1> y;
      }
parameters {
            real<lower=0,upper=1> theta;
            }
model {
       theta ~ beta(1,2);  // uniform prior on interval 0,1
       y ~ bernoulli(theta);
}")
```
:::


Now we may compile the model,
if this has not been done yet.


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(def model
  (stan/model model-code))
```
:::


Here is the output of compiling our model:


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(-> model
    :out
    kind/code)
```
:::



::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
make: '/tmp/scicloj-files/session-dir-11513059202359983753/file-16479827438631490837' is up to date.
```
:::


Here are some toy data:


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(def data
  {:N 10
   :y [0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]})
```
:::


Let us sample from the posterior of $\theta$
given out observed $y$ in the data.
(Soon we will support relevant options
to control the sampling process.)


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(def sampling
  (stan/sample model data {:num-chains 4
                           :num-warmup 200
                           :num-samples 100}))
```
:::


Here is the output of sampling process.
